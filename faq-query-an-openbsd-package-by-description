title: Is there a way to query an OpenBSD package by description?

url: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/335259/is-there-a-way-to-query-an-openbsd-package-by-description

question: [In OpenBSD's package manager, I was hoping it was possible to search by keyword in the packages comment/description section, not just by package name.]

answer: [ $ find /usr/ports -type f -name 'DESCR*' -exec grep "something" {} +]

[ $ grep "something" /usr/ports/INDEX
]

[  $ cd /usr/ports
   $ make search key=language
]

[ $ pkg_info -Q pkglocate
  $ pkglocate pkg_info
]
